# ymd75v3isoes
YMDK PCB Keyboard firmware for the 75% version V3. Spanish ISO. 

I use this firmware on this pcb: YMD75 v3 QMK ISO 

(ymd75v3isoes_layout.jpg shows the layout for this firmware)

This firmware was generated in this page: http://mtkeyboard.vip/
(the .json file allow you to load this layout at that page and modify it as you need)


In order to flash the firmware(the .hex file) into the pcb I follow the instructions of this document:

To control and flash the pcb is necessary to use de Zadig software and the QMK Toolbox software as described in the document above.
